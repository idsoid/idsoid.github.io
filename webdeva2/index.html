                    <p>Year 10000 BC/BCE: These "beds" were not the same kind of beds we know of today. 
                    Instead of a soft place to lay it would usually be very rough. 
                    They would usually throw down some leaves inside a shallow chest of sorts 
                    so that they would be more comfortable then just lying on the ground.</p>

                    They were made out of wood and had cloth on the bed to provide comfort. 
                    In these times beds were a very special item to have, where as today they are basically in every home.</p>

                    They improved the bed by making a "stuffing." They would do this by taking hay, cotton, or feathers.
                    This would make it EVEN more comfortable for a user to fall asleep.</p>

                    suspending it in the air. This would allow the bed to be able to move with the motions of a person better, 
                    rather then just sitting on top of a hard surface.</p>

                    This provided more comfort. Also the first cast iron bed was made, along with the first spring mattress. 
                    These kinds of beds were made to produce a less attractive environment for bugs.</p>

                    <em>Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt</em>
                    <p>The earliest recorded use of the modern human device dates back to the civilizations of Mesopotamia around 7,000 BC. 
                    During this time, only the wealthy used pillows. The number of pillows symbolized status so the more pillows one owned
                    the more affluence they held. Pillows have long been produced around the world in order to help solve the reoccurring
                    problem of neck, back, and shoulder pain while sleeping. Besides for comfort, the pillow was also used for keeping
                    bugs and insects out of people's hair, mouth, nose, and ears while sleeping.
                    Pillow use has been associated with the mummies and tombs of ancient Egypt during the 11th dynasty, dating to 2055-1985 B.C. 
                    Ancient Egyptian pillows were wooden or stone headrests. These pillows were mostly used by placing them 
                    under the heads of the deceased because the head of a human was considered to be the essence of life and sacred.</p>

                <div class="odd">
                    <em>Ancient Europe</em>
                    <p>The Romans and Greeks of ancient Europe mastered the creation of the softer type pillow. 
                    These pillows were stuffed with reeds, feathers, and straw in order to make them softer and more comfortable. 
                    Only upper-class people typically owned these softer pillows. 
                    However, all classes of people were allowed to use some type of pillow while sleeping, lying down or sitting in order to give them support. 
                    People in ancient Europe started to use pillows when going to church in order to kneel on while praying and to place holy books on.
                    This is a tradition that still lives on today. In addition, the Romans and Greeks used their 
                    pillows by placing them under the head of those deceased just like the ancient Egyptians did.</p>

                    <em>Ancient China</em>
                    <p>Chinese pillows were traditionally solid, though sometimes used with a softer fabric over them. 
                    Over many Chinese dynasties, pillows were made from a wide range of materials including bamboo, jade, porcelain, wood, and bronze.
                    Ceramic pillows became the most popular. The use of the ceramic pillow first appeared in the Sui dynasty between 581 and 618 
                    while mass production appeared in the Tang dynasty between 618 and 907. The Chinese decorated their pillows by 
                    making them different shapes and by painting pictures of animals, humans, and plants on them. 
                    One common type of pottery used was Cizhou ware. 
                    Chinese ceramic pillows reached their peak in terms of production and use during the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties 
                    between the 10th and 14th century, but slowly phased out during the Ming and Qing dynasties 
                    between 1368 and 1911 with the emergence of better pillow making materials.</p>
